# Orchestration Protocol

Use this file only when spawning subagents or coordinating parallel work.

## Delegation Context

Every subagent prompt should include:

- task
- files to read
- files it may modify
- acceptance criteria
- constraints
- work context path
- reports path, normally `{work_context}/plans/reports/`

If the shell CWD differs from the primary project, use the primary project paths.

## Context Isolation

- Do not pass full conversation history.
- Summarize only decisions needed for the subtask.
- Give exact file paths instead of "look around the repo" unless scouting is the task.
- Keep coordination, merge decisions, and user approvals in the controller session.

## Parallel Work

Use parallel subagents only when file ownership is clear and integration points are known. Avoid parallel edits to the same file, generated artifact, database migration sequence, or shared config.

## Status Protocol

Ask subagents to end with:

```text
Status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
Summary: one or two sentences
Concerns/Blockers: optional
```

Handle `BLOCKED` and `NEEDS_CONTEXT` by changing context, scope, or approach. Do not retry the same failing prompt repeatedly.

## Model Escalation

When the current session or a subagent runs on a model below `fable` (e.g. `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) and hits a hard problem — repeated failed attempts, a high-stakes design fork, or fuzzy requirements — spawn the `kongming` agent for counsel instead of switching the session model. `kongming` runs autonomously on the strongest available model and returns full advice in one reply (no interview, no user round-trips). Give it the task, evidence gathered so far, approaches tried, and the specific question. It advises only; the caller stays responsible for the implementation. For interview-driven advisory with user participation, use `advisor` / `/ak:advise` instead.

For multi-session team work, use `/ak:team` and its skill-local rules.
